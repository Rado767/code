How to connect with bluetooth:

1. Make sure bluetooth is turned on on the computer
2. Turn the brick on
3. Run './bluetoothConnection.sh'
4. Ignore any offers to pair with stuff at the moment
5. A GUI should have appeared by now, if not something is wrong
6. In the list of connections in the GUI select Hackatar (omnidroid potentially)
7. Press the connect button
8. When the bubble appears wanting to pair you click on it
9. Enter in the PIN (6742)
10. If it worked you will be connected

If brick is off it will just fail to connect  
It might fail to connect even if you did everything ok - try again, it sometimes seems to take 2 or 3 attempts

If it doesn't work then speak to James
